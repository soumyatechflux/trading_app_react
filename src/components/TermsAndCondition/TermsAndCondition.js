                            remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the invalid or
                            unenforceable provision shall be interpreted to reflect the original intentions of the parties as
                            closely as possible.
                            Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service or related rights shall not be considered
                            a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
